Online Exam Platform 
After the Corona crisis, the trend began to grow towards digital transformation and artificial intelligence, and this led to a focus on other problems that witnessed the launch of this integrated Exam system that works remotely.

The “Online Exam Platform” is a system aimed more at students to help them overcome their problems as:

1:- Solving the problem of students whose residence is far from the test sites, which leads to the cost of transportation, time, and effort back and forth.
2:-Booking large and expensive places to take the tests
3:-The cost of old tests, which results in cost to the student
4:-Lack of equal opportunities among students
5:-Lack of knowledge of his cumulative level over the course of the various tests

These problems are due to the so-called traditional system, and this is what our system, the “Online Eexam Site,” was born for.

The “Online Exam Platform” works to provide a healthy Exam environment for the student in terms of:

1- Distance Exam: where the student can join the platform and begin his journey in Exam, which relieves him of the problem of transportation and wasted time, effort, and cost.
2-Equal opportunities among students
3-The student does not pay any fees to take the test
4-Knowing the student’s level over the past exams and warning whether his level is improving or worsening
5-The student's ability to know his grade immediately after completing the test
